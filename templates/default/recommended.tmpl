/* This was generated from a template file. Please feel free to update as necessary!
   a couple things to note:
    - Remember to implement specific logic of the service/domain you are trying to test if it not already there in the pkg/

    - To include the tests as part of the E2E Test suite:
       - Update the pkg/framework/describe.go to include the `Describe func` of this new test suite, If you haven't already done so.
       - Import this new package into the cmd/e2e_test.go
