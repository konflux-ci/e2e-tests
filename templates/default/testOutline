  Describe: test PaC component build @github-webhook, @pac-build, @pipeline
    When: a new component without specified branch is created @pac-custom-default-branch
      It: correctly targets the default branch (that is not named 'main') with PaC
      It: triggers a PipelineRun
      It: a related PipelineRun and Github webhook should be deleted after deleting the component
      It: PR branch should not exists in the repo
    When: a new component with specified custom branch branch is created
      It: triggers a PipelineRun
      It: should lead to a PaC init PR creation
      It: the PipelineRun should eventually finish successfully
      It: eventually leads to a creation of a PR comment with the PipelineRun status report
    When: the PaC init branch is updated
      It: eventually leads to triggering another PipelineRun
      It: PipelineRun should eventually finish
      It: eventually leads to another update of a PR with a comment about the PipelineRun status report
    When: the PaC init branch is merged
      It: eventually leads to triggering another PipelineRun
      It: pipelineRun should eventually finish
    When: the component is removed and recreated (with the same name in the same namespace)
      It: should no longer lead to a creation of a PaC PR

  Describe: PLNSRVCE-799 - test pipeline selector @pipeline-selector
    It: a specific Pipeline bundle should be used and additional pipeline params should be added to the PipelineRun if all WhenConditions match
    It: default Pipeline bundle should be used and no additional Pipeline params should be added to the PipelineRun if one of the WhenConditions does not match

  Describe: A secret with dummy quay.io credentials is created in the testing namespace
    It: should override the shared secret
    It: should not be possible to push to quay.io repo (PipelineRun should fail)
