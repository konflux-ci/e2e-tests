# Installation of AppStudio E2E Mode

The following will walk through the deployment of AppStudio E2E mode in Openshift CI Pull Requests jobs

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the tooling, you must have the following prepared

* An OpenShift 4.9 or higher Environment
* A machine from which to run the install (usually your laptop)
  * The OpenShift Command Line Tool (oc)
  * yq
  * jq
  * git
  * Github Token with the following permissions
    * `repo`
    * `delete_repo`
  * Valid quay token where to push AppStudio components images generated by the e2e framework

## Initial Deployment Steps

Before starting the deployment steps of appstudio in e2e mode in Openshift CI you should skip the first 2 steps

1. Access To Openshift Cluster.

2. Login to the cluster as `admin`

   ```bash
    oc login -u <user> -p <password> --server=<oc_api_url>
   ```

3. Install Red Hat App Studio in e2e mode. The e2e framework by default will use the `redhat-appstudio-qe` github organization by default. If you want to change the github org you should define `GITHUB_E2E_ORGANIZATION` environment with your custom github organization

   ```bash
      # In Openshift CI there are some example about how to use the installation script. See infra-deployments script https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/application-service/blob/main/.ci/oci-e2e-has.sh#L59
      $ROOT_DIR/scripts/install-appstudio-e2e-mode.sh install
   ```

4. Compile the e2e tests

   ```bash
    make build
   ```

5. Run the e2e tests

   ```bash
    `$ROOT_DIR/bin/e2e-appstudio`
   ```

Where are:

- `install` - Flag to indicate the installation. If the flag will not be present you can `source` the script and use the bash functions.

The following environments are used to launch the Red Hat AppStudio installation in e2e mode and the tests execution:

| Variable | Required | Explanation | Default Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | yes | A github token used to create AppStudio applications in github  | ''  |
| `QUAY_TOKEN` | yes | A quay token to push components images to quay.io. Note the quay token must be your dockerconfigjson encoded in base64 format, e.g. `ewogI3dJhdXRocyI6I...` | '' |
| `GITHUB_E2E_ORGANIZATION` | no | GitHub Organization where to create/push Red Hat AppStudio Applications  | `redhat-appstudio-qe`  |
| `QUAY_E2E_ORGANIZATION` | no | Quay organization where to push components containers | `redhat-appstudio-qe` |
| `E2E_APPLICATIONS_NAMESPACE` | no | Name of the namespace used for running HAS E2E tests | `appstudio-e2e-test` |
| `PRIVATE_DEVFILE_SAMPLE` | no | The name of the private git repository used in HAS E2E tests. Your GITHUB_TOKEN should be able to read from it. | `https://github.com/redhat-appstudio-qe/private-quarkus-devfile-sample` |


### Setting up the required tokens

#### GitHub token

[Instructions for creating a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

Make sure to give the token the permissions listed in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

Copy the resulting token (should look similar to `ghp_Iq...`) and save it off somewhere as you'll be using it for the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable whenever you want to run the e2e suite.

#### Quay token

Go to your profile (in Quay click your username in the upper right, click Account Settings). From your profile, look for CLI Password and click the Generate Encrypted Password link. Click on Kubernetes Secret in the left pane. Click on the link for View username-secret.yml. Copy the string listed after `.dockerconfigjson` (should look similar to `ewogI3...`). Save the string off somewhere as you'll be using it for the QUAY_TOKEN environment variable whenever you want to run the e2e suite.


## Install e2e binary in openshift-ci and use pairing PRs feature

The e2e tests are executed against almost all App Studio repositories.

Sometimes when we have changes in App Studio we are introducing some breaking changes and the e2e will fail. To prevent this the e2e framework installation in openshift-ci support a new feature of pairing the PR opened against an App Studio repository with the e2e forks based in branch names. Before the e2e framework will be executed in openshift-ci, the logic automatically tries to pair a PR opened in some repo with a branch of the same name that
potentially could exists in the developer's fork of the e2e repository

For example, if a developer with GH account `cooljohn` opens a PR (for application-service repo) from a branch `new-feature`, then the logic checks if there is a branch `new-feature` also in the `cooljohn/e2e-tests` fork and if exists will start to install the e2e framework from those branch

To install App Studio E2E framework in openshift-ci and use the pairing feature it is necessary to perform:

```bash
   $ROOT_DIR/scripts/e2e-openshift-ci.sh
```
