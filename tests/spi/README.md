# Service Provider Integration tests suite

This suite contains a set of tests that covers SPI scenarios. For detailed information regarding the SPI functionalities, please read the [SPI documentation](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator/blob/main/docs/USER.md).


Steps to run 'spi-suite':

1) Follow the instructions from the [Readme](../../docs/Installation.md) scripts to install AppStudio in e2e mode
2) Run `make build`
3) Run the e2e suite: `./bin/e2e-appstudio --ginkgo.focus="spi-suite"`

# Scenarios

## Ensure that a user can't access and use secrets from another workspace ([SVPI-495](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-495), [access-control.go](https://github.com/konflux-ci/e2e-tests/blob/main/tests/spi/access-control.go))
Access control tests are important to detect/prevent misconfigurations in authentication and authorization mechanisms. Being SPI responsible for obtaining authentication tokens, we need to be sure that a user cannot access and use secrets from workspaces that should not have access.


## Get file content from a private Github repository with Remote Secret ([SVPI-402](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-402), [SVPI-621](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-621), [get-file-content-rs.go](https://github.com/konflux-ci/e2e-tests/blob/main/tests/spi/get-file-content-rs.go))
One of the SPI's uses cases is the [file content request](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator/blob/main/docs/USER.md#retrieving-file-content-from-scm-repository). In order to request the file content of private GitHub repositories, a GitHub token is needed. So, a Remote Secret should be deployed with a GitHub token, before the file content request.


## Get file content from a private Github repository with SPIAccessToken [*marked for deletion*] ([SVPI-402](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-402), [get-file-content.go](https://github.com/konflux-ci/e2e-tests/blob/main/tests/spi/get-file-content.go))
Another way of getting file content from a private Github repository is through SPIAccessToken (SPIAccessTokenBinding). The SPIAccessTokenBinding should be in the Injected phase, before the file content request.


## Check SA creation and linking to the secret requested by SPIAccessTokenBinding [*marked for deletion*] ([SVPI-406](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-406), [link-secret-sa.go](https://github.com/konflux-ci/e2e-tests/blob/main/tests/spi/link-secret-sa.go))
One of the SPIAccessTokenBinding functionalities is [providing secrets to a service account](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator/blob/main/docs/USER.md#providing-secrets-to-a-service-account). There are three ways of linking secrets to a SA: link a secret to an existing service account, link a secret to an existing service account as image pull secret, and link a secret to a managed service account.


## Github OAuth flow to upload token ([SVPI-395](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-395), [oauth.go](https://github.com/konflux-ci/e2e-tests/blob/main/tests/spi/oauth.go))
The oauth authentication flow involves some steps that can only be executed in the browser; e2e-tests do this by using [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) framework to simulate the user steps. The specs that Cypress will run are located in [this repository](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio-qe/cypress-browser-oauth-flow). After creating SPI needed resources, e2e completes the steps a user would perform in a browser by creating a short-lived pod with the Cypress image, injecting the cypress specs by cloning the above repo and running them.
To complete the authentication, a test user is needed: the tests expect username, password and the 2FA setup key to be provided. 

SPI service needs to be configured to use the authentication providers. E2E-tests do this automatically in the setup phase, by expecting the clientid and secret of an oauth application for each supported provider to be supplied via environment variables. 

If tests are running in CI, we need to handle the dynamic url the cluster is assigned with every time e2e-tests run. To do that, we use a simple redirect proxy that allows us to: 
- set a static oauth callback url in the providerâ€™s configuration; 
- redirect the callback calls from the authentication providers to the spi component in our cluster. 
The OAUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL env should contain the url of such proxy and the callback url of you oauth apps should be set with the same url. 
The proxy is stateless, requires no prior registration and the redirect translation will happen automatically using the state data provided by the SPI component itself.
The redirect proxy used is in [this repository](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio-qe/spi-oauth-redirect-proxy).

If not running in CI, SPI expects that the callback url in the provider configuration is set to the default one: homepage URL + /oauth/callback


## Check ImagePullSecret usage for the private Quay image and check the secret that can be used with scopeo Tekton task to authorize a copy of one private Quay image to the second Quay image repository [*marked for deletion*] ([SVPI-407](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-407), [SVPI-408](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-408), [quay-imagepullsecret-usage.go](https://github.com/konflux-ci/e2e-tests/blob/main/tests/spi/quay-imagepullsecret-usage.go))
To avoid code repetition, SVPI-408 was integrated with SVPI-407.


## Upload token with k8s secret [*marked for deletion*] ([SVPI-399](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-399), [token-upload-k8s.go](https://github.com/konflux-ci/e2e-tests/blob/main/tests/spi/token-upload-k8s.go))
One of the ways to upload secrets to SPI is [using Kubernetes Secret](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator/blob/main/docs/USER.md#uploading-access-token-to-spi-using-kubernetes-secret).


## Token upload rest endpoint [*marked for deletion*] ([SVPI-398](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SVPI-398), [token-upload-rest-endpoint.go](https://github.com/konflux-ci/e2e-tests/blob/main/tests/spi/token-upload-rest-endpoint.go))
Another way of uploading secrets to SPI is using [REST endpoint](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/service-provider-integration-operator/blob/main/docs/USER.md#storing-username-and-password-credentials-for-any-provider-by-its-url).
